<div id="introInfo">
I was born in Ecuador in 1994. My academic career began with a Bachelor's degree in marine biology and genetics at the University of Queensland. Some of my passions are science, environment, conservation, teaching, fitness, and nutrition. Future aspirations let me move to Beijing and do a master's degree in environmental science at Beijing Normal University on risk assessment and pollution. The constant use of R software expanded my enthusiasm for data analysis in a broad range of environment-related fields, motivating me to joined a doctoral program.
