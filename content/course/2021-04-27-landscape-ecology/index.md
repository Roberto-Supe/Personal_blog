## Program overview

This short course was created to provide an additional option to quantify landscape configuration using **R**. The landscape subject to analysis is powerful and can represent any spatial phenomenon. R will quantify, sample, and show the areal extent and spatial configuration of patches within a landscape. We will cover a few important steps for data analysis and visualization. This site was build by Roberto Supe Tulcan (PhD student) and the research team of [Professor Shiliang Liu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Shiliang-Liu-5), course coordinator and lecturer of Landscape Ecology at Beijing Normal University.
