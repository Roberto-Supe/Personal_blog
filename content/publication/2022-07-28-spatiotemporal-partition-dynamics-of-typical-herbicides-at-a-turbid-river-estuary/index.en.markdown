title: 'Spatiotemporal partition dynamics of typical herbicides at a turbid river estuary'
abstract: 'Organic pollutants are ubiquitous in estuarine areas, nonetheless, the transport mechanisms of herbicides in such areas are limited. Atrazine and acetochlor were analyzed in suspended particle matter (SPM), surface sediment, and surface water from the Yellow River estuary and the surrounding rivers and sea. Among these rivers, the Yellow River contributes the most herbicide flux to the sea annually. The herbicide concentrations in water and sediment decreased from the estuarine areas to the deep sea. The fugacity fraction values of atrazine exceeded 0.5 in the Yellow River estuary, which supported that the herbicides in sediment desorbed at the estuarine areas. The herbicide in the SPM showed high concentration in the outer sea and increased as a power function with decreasing SPM content. The increasing partition capacity indicated that the herbicides tended to sink into sediment, increasing the ecological risk posed by herbicides. The ecological risk of acetochlor deserves continuous attention.'
