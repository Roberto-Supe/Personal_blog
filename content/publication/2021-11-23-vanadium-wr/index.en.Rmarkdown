abstract: 'Vanadium has been classified as a potentially toxic metal and has been given limited attention in comparison to similar trace metals. Similarly, worldwide and continental vanadium pollution and risks remain contested. Here, we synthesized the worldwide concentration of vanadium in marine ecosystems with the relevant ecological and human health risks. We found that vanadium in biota and seawater collected from Asia shows significant increases over the temporal analysis, with rates similar to those reported for vanadium consumption and production. Furthermore, invertebrates have a higher concentration of vanadium than fishes. Similarly, we demonstrate that sediments classified as polluted have concentrations that are not directly correlated with the highest concentrations across continents. Finally, ecological risks were higher from seawater, with potential impacts to 55% of aquatic species in Asia estimated from chronic species sensitivity distribution (SSD). The concentration endangering only 5% of seawater species (HC5) was estimated as 1.13 (0.05-21.19) Î¼g/L. Estimated daily intakes revealed that overall, there are none to low health risks from aquatic product consumption, yet high risks are plausible to children with consumption patterns in the 95th percentile.'
title: 'Vanadium pollution and health risks in marine ecosystems: Anthropogenic sources over natural contributions'
summary: 'Vanadium is part of many industries and products, and its use has increased significantly over the last two decades. Our research gathered information from over 250 articles and found that the concentration of vanadium in marine organisms has similar trends to worldwide use and production of vanadium. Here, we further investigated multiple characteristics of vanadium in coastal ecosystems (sediment, water, biota) and its ecological and health risks. There is a need further to explore the hazards and toxicity of this metal and set new guidelines to protect aquatic species that, from the available data and reported concentrations, are likely to be at risk under our SSD analysis. Vanadium is a rarely investigated heavy metal despite similarities with other traditional elements like arsenic or mercury. Nonetheless, it has gained significant importance in our society, whereby it is essential to control and monitor its occurrence and distribution.'
